    "btac_hazard": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The weather forecasters labeled yesterday as the warmest day since last fall for much of the region. It was a warm one and was highlighted by continued wet loose activity being noted by human triggers after a widespread natural cycle, which occurred on April 10. Things today will be ever so slightly cooler and with a bit more cloud cover, but the lack of a true refreeze is keeping many of us on our toes. It&rsquo;s been a winter of records and extremes, with record snowfall and now several days of very warm temperatures&mdash;just to our south our friends in Utah are in the midst of unprecedented avalanche activity that went from dry slabs to wet almost instantly. Yesterday I experienced one of the larger spring snowpack collapses I&rsquo;ve had in quite some time - a signal of the lack of refreezes and buried weaker snow. My point is to let things simmer down some more before beginning to poke around in avalanche terrain again. Cooler weather and some snow are on the horizon.</p>",

We're expecting 2-6 inches from this storm by Friday \u2014 nothing huge by any means but we'll take it! With a few days straight of warm weather, snow instability is a real issue.

A reminder for those who plan to ski or ride today \u2014 UDOT will be closing the canyon between 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. thru Thursday this week due to increased avalanche hazard. Check the UDOT website or social media channels for the status of the canyon road and stay tuned to our app or website for the latest updates from Solitude."
