    "btac_hazard": "<p>W.U.T.A.N.G. Season</p>\n<p>That's right, another handy snow acronym to add to the list you probably might be familiar with. Though created jokingly, it actually is pretty applicable. W.U.T.A.N.G. stands for <strong>W</strong>et, <strong>U</strong>nconsolidated, <strong>T</strong>errain, <strong>A</strong>spect, <strong>N</strong>on-refrozen, and <strong>G</strong>lide. Over the next two days when you encounter wet, mushy snow, particularly on solar aspects in terrain capable of producing an avalanche, or if glide avalanches are occurring, you've got some wet snow problems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The upper 1-3 feet of snow that fell during a relatively cool and stormy month of March is undergoing rapid change. Today you'll be able to find anything from dry, cold powder to straight-up wet glop&mdash;likely all in one run. Although dry snow surfaces are harder to find, they're still out there, and this will be the spot you're most likely to encounter any remaining surface wind slabs, and probably a questionable persistent layer or two. Intense warming can have unpredictable effects on rapidly settling and deforming slab + weak layer combos. Slab avalanches will be possible today and tomorrow. Cornices (while not entirely wet) will sag in ever-intensifying heat. It's important to give these huge hunks of snow some respect as a hazard in their own right, but also know that they have the potential to trigger larger slab avalanches as they tumble downslope. Warm temperatures today and tomorrow will send meltwater deeper into the snowpack, which leaves the potential for any snow movement to entrain more volume. More volume will equal farther travel distances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The snow conditions today will be dynamic and your travel plans should be too. Not all of these problems will give you fair warning before they occur and I'm choosing to travel conservatively by building in a wide safety margin to help deal with my uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday,</strong> skies remained cloudy to overcast across much of our region, with partly cloudy skies above the Greys River zone. Overnight, temperatures in the mountains dipped into the high teens to low 20s F, providing the snowpack some reprieve and refreeze.&nbsp; Light to moderate winds blew out of the S-SW throughout the day.</p>\n<p><strong>Today,</strong> current mountain temperatures are hovering in the mid to high 20s F. Cloud cover will depart throughout the morning with plenty of sunshine on the menu. Mountain temperatures quickly climb into the upper 30s F and look above freezing across the board by afternoon, as valley bottom temperatures climb into the mid to upper 40s F. Light winds continue to blow out of the S-SW-W throughout the day. Tomorrow will be even warmer than today, with mountain temperatures pushing into the 40s and 50s F and valley bottom temps climbing into the 60s F. Remember to still pack that puffy jacket, particularly if traveling above 10,000 feet, and don't forget the sunscreen.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>Avalanche conditions will become increasingly hazardous throughout the day. This morning, your primary concern will be avalanches failing on weak layers 2+ feet deep in addition to isolated pockets of 6-10 inch wind slab in steep terrain. As the day heats up, the likelihood of natural and human-triggered wet snow avalanches will increase significantly. Don't linger below large avalanche paths and avoid areas with wet, soggy snow.</p>",
    "legecast": "6 AM- Well, this is it, the day so many of us wished would never come. But time keeps on ticking away, so just submit and have some fun. We've got a spectacular day in store for our final send off, with mostly sunny skies and warm temperatures lined up to keep you smiling from bell to bell. Highs will soar into the 40's atop Rendezvous Mountain and Teton Village will make its way well into the 50's. A gentle breeze from the West will cap off the beautiful weather as it caresses the springtime slope conditions between 5-15 mph. 136 days ago we began a voyage of deep discovery together and today we come full circle. Tomorrow the tall tales will begin to unfold, but the truth of what happened could never actually be told. Personal experiences will forever reside deep inside a grey matter fold; Too ethereal to touch, but solid enough for guaranteed futures to be happily sold. Debates will rage over which season was preeminent, but the true sage knows that such contentions are utterly irrelevant. There are so many things that could still be said, but I think I'll be better off if I just go shred instead. See you soon. -Lege",

Check the UDOT website or social media channels for the status of the canyon road and stay tuned to our app or website for the latest updates from Solitude. For those skiing and riding today, bring your sweet tooth! The Easter Bunny has arrived, and she\u2019s been hiding eggs on the slopes and in Solitude Village. Check our events calendar for details. Spring conditions will be in full effect today with crisp snow to start, followed by extra soft snow once the mountain warms. Expect delays or early closures on gated terrain due to spring conditions. We expect plenty of sun \u00a0\u2014 don\u2019t forget to put sunscreen on your legs if you are planning on wearing shorts."
