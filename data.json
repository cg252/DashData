All possible imperfections have been etch-a-sketched out of existence and gusty West winds with light to moderate snowfall will continue to smooth out the slopes through the day. Expected high temperatures will top out in the upper teens at Corbet's Cabin and the upper 20's in the Village. The fine line between dreamscape and reality has been irreparably blurred and any attempt to differentiate is utterly absurd.

Yesterday patrol opened the entire west face of Honeycomb making for some awesome skiing, and that terrain should be great today as well.
