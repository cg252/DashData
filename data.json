Forecaster Catino observed lots of wet loose activity shedding off of steep faces and an impressive avalanche that ran to the valley floor on a south aspect (likely ran during the last storm). Avalanche activity was observed in Avalanche Canyon two days ago, mostly wind slabs that were size 1.5 or less.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Have left the 3/20 and 3/29 persistent slab problems in place for now, but sensitivity is expected to go down after the peak heating today and subsequent refreeze tonight. &nbsp;The 3/29 interface seems to be more of an issue where it is presenting as a crust, northerly aspects do not seem to be as concerning as easterlies and southerlies. The same cannot be said of the 3/20 interface where it is a layer of NSF on NNE aspects.&nbsp;</p>",

Check the UDOT website or social media channels for the status of the canyon road and stay tuned to our app or website for the latest updates from Solitude. For those skiing and riding today, bring your sweet tooth! The Easter Bunny has arrived, and she\u2019s been hiding eggs on the slopes and in Solitude Village. Check our events calendar for details. Spring conditions will be in full effect today with crisp snow to start, followed by extra soft snow once the mountain warms. Expect delays or early closures on gated terrain due to spring conditions. We expect plenty of sun \u00a0\u2014 don\u2019t forget to put sunscreen on your legs if you are planning on wearing shorts."
