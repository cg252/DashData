    "btac_hazard": "<p><strong>March Madness</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just when we thought winter was winding down&hellip; BOOOM another serious storm cycle hits! Over the last 5 days the Tetons have received around 3 feet of new snow with localized higher amounts on the west side near Targhee. Yesterday increased winds amplified reactivity causing numerous D1-D2 avalanches&nbsp; in the middle and upper elevations. Our main concern is the new snow instability, which as you&rsquo;ve read sits on a weak interface. Areas with the highest reactivity are aspects that contain small near surface facets above a melt freeze crust. This interface could be trending towards a persistent slab problem due to the characteristics of avalanches remotely triggered the last two days. Continual rapid loading makes this assessment difficult, so we&rsquo;ll monitor this trend as the storm snow stabilizes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With remote triggered avalanches possible, careful route finding will be the key ingredient to satisfying your powder fever. Assess the slope angles you plan to travel on and stay off steep slopes, especially above 35&deg;. Identifying start zones and open slopes where avalanches occurrences are common will help aid your terrain choice. Don&rsquo;t let powder fever cloud your judgment. This winter has been a long season, so avoid becoming lulled into complacency. </span></p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Snowfall from this recent storm cycle began to taper off for the majority of the forecast area. The exception was Grand Targhee, which received 22 inches of new snow with 3-6 inches for the rest of the Tetons as well as the Greys and 2-4 inches at Togwotee. Temperatures dropped yesterday with minimums of zero overnight and rising to the teens around 9000&rsquo;. Westerly winds from SW to NW sustained above 20 mph for the majority of the day with gusts to 44 mph before decreasing below 20 late last night. Skies remained overcast and cloudy.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong>Today</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Scattered snow showers should remain below 3 inches across all three zones except where snow banding sets up and increases snowfall amounts. Temperatures will remain cold, starting out near zero and rising again to the teens. W/SW winds will continue 10-20 mph. Skies should remain mostly cloudy. </span></p>",

    "legecast": "6 AM: Greetings Jackson Hole. A wild week of snow and wind is wrapping up in a more mellow fashion, but with plenty of lingering stashes to fuel your powder passion. After 4\" of fresh during the past 24 hours and 1\" overnight, the Rendezvous Bowl tally for the season has blasted past the 550 mark. Cloudy skies will reign over the Tetons today, potentially producing a passing snow shower or two. Expect unseasonably chilly temperatures, as the summit rises only to the teens and the Village struggles to make it into the mid 20's. West-Southwest winds will be blowing across the slopes in the neighborhood of 5-20 mph. If you come to find that your mind is playing tricks on you from the non-stop adrenaline onslaught, just play along. Because when you surrender to the flow and dance to the rhythm of your own personal song, nothing can ever go wrong. -Lege",
