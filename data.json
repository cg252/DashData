    "btac_hazard": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The upper elevations of the Tetons have received about 100&rdquo; of snow containing 7.5&rdquo; snow water equivalent (SWE) since February 2nd. This is a significant load that is sitting on a poor structure. In the long term, the snow that we have received over the past two weeks is great news for stability. It has helped to bury the concerning weak layers of snow at depths where humans will have a hard time impacting them. Unfortunately, the loading event is too recent to trust the snowpack at the moment. We are only two days out from a significant natural avalanche cycle. The snowpack is still adjusting to the recent loading, despite the signs becoming more difficult to detect. Patience and conservative decision making are recommended while the snowpack adjusts. Building in an extra margin of safety to account for surprises is a good idea today.</span></p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday </strong>brought clear, sunny skies and calm to light southwest winds. Many recent avalanches were noted from the past 72 hours in this weather clearing. Daytime highs climbed above freezing and into the mid to high 30s&deg; F, and many slopes on the south half of the compass now have crusty surface snow. Overnight temperatures plummeted to the teens and single digits. Winds remained southwesterly and confined to upper elevations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Today </strong>expect stormy conditions to develop and another round of snowfall to hit our mountains. The Teton Zone is expected to receive 4-6 inches, around 3 inches in the Greys, and 2 inches at Togwotee Pass.&nbsp; Snowfall may be intense at times, and winds trending westerly and increasing consistently into the teens-20s mph range. Temperatures are expected to remain well below freezing and average in the 20s&deg; F.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Careful snowpack evaluation will be important today and conservative terrain choices are recommended. </span></p>",
    "legecast": "6 AM- Rise and shine all you fall-line fanatics, but don't expect Sunday to deliver yesterday's bluebird antics. Because clouds are rolling their way back into the Hole, ready to drop the next layer for you to lap up. Periods of snow through the day will be complimented by mild high temperatures that rise to the mid 20's at the summit and near 30 in the Village, following the breakdown of a little morning inversion. Gusty winds from the Southwest will increase in intensity adding some spaced out visuals as they aid in resurfacing the slopes. So, hop outta bed and skip the shower, because the falling pow's power will get you cleaner than Pantene. Just jump a Tram and let the lightning jolt of dopamine take you off to mysterious places that you've never seen. -Lege\u00a0\nPlease utilize the START Bus or Stilson Express, as parking will fill early and be very limited this weekend.\u00a0",

The mid-elevation slopes that received generally less wind and snow have a MODERATE danger.\r\rAny avalanches, wind-drifted snow, or new snow may be more sensitive today due to weak grains at the new snow, old snow interface, particularly on aspects with a southeasterly or easterly direction. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today.\r\rIf the sun comes out this afternoon, the snow surface could heat up, and we could begin seeing small wet-loose avalanches on solar aspects.

    "UT_recentactivity": "\rYesterday was a busy day in the backcountry, with about 20 avalanches reported in the Salt Lake, Ogden, and Provo area mountains since Friday. The majority of these avalanches failed as soft slabs of new snow or wind-drifted snow, occurring within a density inversion in the storm snow or at the interface with the old snow surface, particularly on solar aspects that had previously been exposed to sunlight. These areas now have a firm melt-freeze crust with weak stellars or faceted grains at the interface between the new and old snow. The focal aspect seems to be southeast, as demonstrated by the three separate avalanches on Superior, the deeper conehead avalanche off of the Park City ridgeline (video shown below), and the countless other observations that were reported.&nbsp;Most of these avalanches broke 10\"-2' deep and were anywhere from 40'-250' wide.\r\r&nbsp;\r\rVideo of the Conehead&nbsp;Avalanche off the Park City Ridgeline, 10,000' - SE Aspect&nbsp;- Full Observation HERE&nbsp;- M.

We grabbed 1 inch overnight and it\u2019s snowing this morning; 3 to 5 inches of new snow is expected today. So far, we\u2019ve received 88 inches of snow in February, making for an awesome month of soft skiing and riding. All of our terrain was opened yesterday with the exception of Fantasy Ridge. The same terrain should be open again today, with fresh tracks still available. Depending on weather and conditions, terrain is always subject to delays and closures. Stay updated on what's open, closed or delayed by downloading the Solitude app or checking out the lifts & trails section on our website. Presidents' Day weekend has been delivering great skiing and riding, top to bottom \u2014 don\u2019t miss out!"
