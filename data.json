Another 6-10\" is forecasted today. The characteristics each day have been significantly different. Low density snow around 5% accompanied the first pulse. Then temperatures and wind increased creating dense, firmer snow. And today you&rsquo;ll find new snow slightly less dense (hopefully) due to lower wind speeds. There is a lot of uncertainty in trying to predict how exactly all these interfaces between storms will behave. The bottom line is we&rsquo;re getting a lot of snow rapidly. A serious red flag. Especially in combination with consistently strong winds. Avoid runout zones beneath steep terrain in the alpine due to natural avalanche potential. Assess the new snow very thoroughly or simply stick to lower angle slopes to stay safe in the backcountry today. Managing the wind and storm slab instability by choosing lower angle terrain will also help manage the uncertainty in the persistent slab problems.&nbsp;</span></p>",

Increased temperatures and wind created dense snow quality. Winds remained out of the W/SW 20-30 mph with gusts to near 50 mph drifting snow. The JHMR Summit weather station reported almost 600 total miles of wind (blustery). Temperatures remained warm reaching near 30 in middle to lower elevations, especially warm in the Snake River Canyon where light rain was reported.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winter storm warnings are in effect until Friday at 5pm across all three forecast zones. Pacific moisture will continue today with 6-10&rdquo; in the Tetons, 4-8&rdquo; in the Greys and Togwotee. Temperatures will be in the mid to high 20s reaching 30 degF in warmer areas of the Greys such as Alpine. Winds will continue out of the SW 20-30 mph drifting snow throughout the day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forecasted snow finally decreases tonight bringing calmer weather on Saturday before another wave of moisture hits the area Sunday. Yet another wave is expected early next week.</span></p>",

    "legecast": "6 AM- KaBoom!!! A 15\" plastering of pow blasted the upper reaches of Rendezvous Mountain over the past 24 hours. That brings the tally for the past four days to an astounding 45\". More snow will fall through the morning, before fading off into partly clearing skies this afternoon. Mild temperatures will rise to the low 20's at Corbet's Cabin and near the 30-degree mark in Teton Village. Gusty winds in the neighborhood of 10-30 mph will have the crystal contrails swirling, as they swing towards the West-Northwest. These are the days of which we dream, the ones we swore we'd never miss. Plans can always be remade so blow it off, no matter who you have to dis. Focus on the reverberating shockwaves of euphoric neurochemicals that will invade your apr\u00e8s hours, as faceshot-flashbacks return you to a fantasy land of flotational bliss. -Lege\u00a0",

Due to the heavy snowfall, Summit was closed, along with the majority of our terrain gates. Some areas may experience closures or delays today due to storm conditions and ongoing mitigation efforts. Please respect the work of our patrol by not ducking ropes and staying out of closed terrain, the fresh powder isn't going anywhere! The entire mountain, from base to summit, ensures excellent skiing and riding conditions today. For the latest updates on grooming, terrain status, closures, and delays, be sure to download the Solitude app or visit our website's lifts & trails section.
