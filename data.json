    "btac_hazard": "<p class=\"nac-html-p\">Every time we get to enter the backcountry, it is the chance to view our surroundings with a child-like curiosity.&nbsp; When it all boils down to it, skiing or sledding is a chance to play outside with our friends and be in a phenomenally interesting compound (snow) that is in a constant state of change. As you move through the mountains, take the time to observe the nature of the snow you are traveling through. How has the wind reshaped the snowpack overnight, and why does the snow you are moving through feel and look like it does? Look for areas where the wind has scoured down and revealed old ski and sled tracks underneath. Is yesterday's track now nowhere to be found due to winds continuing to move snow? This process of observation is one of the most powerful tools in our safe backcountry travel in our toolkit. It is also what enables us to sniff out areas with good, stable skiing and riding, and makes us masters of our own exposure to hazards. There is always something new (and usually something older to track) in the world of snow, we just have to choose to look.</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday</strong> saw mostly clear skies and colder temperatures with high diffuse clouds in the alpine. Gusts were southwesterly in the 35 mph range and ridgelines at 10,000' saw consistent wind in the teens mph. Light winds are expected today from the S/SW, shifting SE into tomorrow.</p>\n<p><strong>Today,</strong> dry weather will persist until Wednesday morning. Skies are expected to remain overcast but may break down midday allowing some sunshine through. Temperatures are expected to remain below normal, with highs in the 20s deg F and warming into Wednesday's incoming southwest flow. Yet another pulse of active weather and Pacific moisture is headed our way from Wednesday-Friday, with accumulations of 6 inches expected in the mountains, and rain at lower elevations.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>Avoid steep slopes where you find evidence of windblown snow. Slides could also break into buried weak layers, producing a more dangerous avalanche. These are most likely above 9,000 feet and could be triggered remotely&mdash;from gentler terrain below, above, and to the sides of steep slopes. Be alert to the consequences of being caught in an avalanche in the terrain you are traveling in.</p>",
    "legecast": "6AM - Good morning world! We're looking a dry start to the day but if you haven't been satiated by all of the snow this year, fear not: we've got some coming down the pike. The chance of precip will increase this afternoon as the next series of Pacific fronts and troughs arrives. Any snowfall today will be on the lighter side with the steadier stuff rolling in tonight. Wind speeds will increase today as well but nothing too dramatic is expected. High temps around the base will be in the high 30s and the summit will see high 20s. See you on the hill! -Orion",
