    "btac_hazard": "<p>The overlap of the seasonal transition and buried weak layers produces plenty of fodder for avalanche forecasters. I'll mention wet slabs here not necessarily because I think they are going to be happening today, but because they are likely to be a problem in at least one of the zones, and it is good for us all to still keep persistent layering in mind. At this seasonal stage, slab avalanches are very interesting. A personal observation I've made over time is that some slab activity at this transition never really appears fully wet or dry. Moist slabs?</p>\n<p>On upper and middle-elevation slopes that don't directly face the sun, the snowpack is still cold and dry. At lower elevations and on all slopes that face the sun, the warm temperatures and direct sunshine of the past two weeks have begun to push meltwater down into the snowpack. When the snowpack is freezing solidly at night we like this; it behaves in a more predictable diurnal pattern of melting during the day and then refreezing at night. This pattern usually means that avalanche activity is restricted to surficial wet loose avalanches. However, when ambient air temperatures stay near freezing overnight this re-freeze is much weaker. Without a solid freeze over the span of several days, significant amounts of meltwater can accumulate in the snowpack. If you are out in the mountains today and you are finding a snowpack that is either saturated with water OR recently dry snow surfaces that are now becoming moist on shaded aspects, you will be well served the think about both the possibility of wet avalanches and the possibility of awakening any persistent issues.</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday</strong> was a beautiful spring day. Skies cleared throughout the morning leading to bluebird conditions and light southwesterly winds. Temperatures reached 46 F at 9,500 feet in the Tetons, 48 F in the Greys River, and 44 F at Togwotee Pass yesterday. Overnight lows hovered in the high 20s F, and current temperatures are already creeping into the 30s F at 9,000 feet. &nbsp;Skies were mostly clear, allowing the snowpack surface to weakly freeze in open terrain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Today&nbsp;</strong>expect another beautiful day with increasing southwest winds into Tuesday. Temperatures are expected to peak in the 40s F up to 10,000 feet. Tuesday will provide some respite for the snowpack as a cold front moves our way.

The threat of wet snow avalanches will increase as the day warms up. These slides are most likely on very steep slopes that directly face the sun but are possible on shaded slopes. Additionally be on the lookout for small wind drifts in very steep, upper-elevation terrain, and cornices on ridgelines. Don't linger below large avalanche paths and avoid areas with wet, soggy snow.</p>",
    "legecast": "6 AM- Well, this is it, the day so many of us wished would never come. But time keeps on ticking away, so just submit and have some fun. We've got a spectacular day in store for our final send off, with mostly sunny skies and warm temperatures lined up to keep you smiling from bell to bell. Highs will soar into the 40's atop Rendezvous Mountain and Teton Village will make its way well into the 50's. A gentle breeze from the West will cap off the beautiful weather as it caresses the springtime slope conditions between 5-15 mph. 136 days ago we began a voyage of deep discovery together and today we come full circle. Tomorrow the tall tales will begin to unfold, but the truth of what happened could never actually be told. Personal experiences will forever reside deep inside a grey matter fold; Too ethereal to touch, but solid enough for guaranteed futures to be happily sold. Debates will rage over which season was preeminent, but the true sage knows that such contentions are utterly irrelevant. There are so many things that could still be said, but I think I'll be better off if I just go shred instead. See you soon. -Lege",

Things will start out relatively firm but will likely turn slushy as the day goes on. These warming temps bring additional avalanche hazard as our historic snowpack begins to melt off and make its way downhill. Our patrollers will be assessing conditions to monitor for hazards, and may close terrain throughout the day. For the latest on terrain status and closures, check the Solitude app. It's a similar story on the roads, with UDOT planning daily canyon closures between 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. thru Thursday this week due to increased avalanche hazard. Check the UDOT website or social media channels for the status of the canyon road and stay tuned to our app or website for the latest updates from Solitude."
