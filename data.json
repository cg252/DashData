I&rsquo;m sure a lot of us have been looking forward to those sunny spring days, but that will certainly not be the case today as you&rsquo;ll find stormy conditions with continued snowfall and harsh winds. The challenge will be choosing terrain and evaluating avalanche conditions based on what you see out there as avalanche danger increases by this afternoon. The consistent problem will be strong winds creating sensitive wind slabs. The more uncertain problem will be the unpredictable nature of persistent slabs. The easiest option to manage this problem is to simply stay humble, choose the conservative terrain, and wait for conditions to stabilize before riding those steep, challenging zones. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by this complex snowpack even though it&rsquo;s April. </span></p>",

Temperatures rose into the low to high 20s above 8000&rsquo; with lows in the teens.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong>Today</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: More snow on the way with varying forecasted amounts of 4-10 inches in the Tetons and 2-4 inches in the Greys and Togwotee, with an exception in the Snake River Range of 6-8 inches. The key highlight in today&rsquo;s weather will be the strong SW winds sustaining 20-30 mph and gusty conditions up to 50 mph by this afternoon. Temperatures will remain in the high teens to low 20s. </span></p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Large variability in new snow across the zone will create dangerous avalanche conditions in the upper elevations in areas such as GTNP which received 15 inches of new snow yesterday. Strong, gusty SW winds will form slabs that will be most sensitive during active loading and stress weak layers buried 2-3 feet deep. Identify and avoid heavily wind loaded slopes while choosing conservative terrain to manage the uncertainty of the persistent slab problem.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avalanche danger will increase throughout the day with continued snow and&nbsp; sustained 20-30 mph winds. </span></em></p>",
    "legecast": "6AM - Pop outta bed Jackson. I know it's the first of the month, but this ain't no foolin'. The alpine stage is set with a layer of fresh that's sure to get everyone droolin'. 9 inches fell on the upper mountain over the past 24 hours with more than half coming after the lifts closed yesterday. You'd be forgiven for thinking this is a practical joke, but you'll become a true believer when you get engulfed by a cloud of cold smoke. So, head to the village prepared for continued snowfall and high temperatures that reach the low 20's at the summit and the low 30's in the base area. Expect gusty Southwest winds to whip in the neighborhood of 15-30 mph, with the occasional blast pushing the 40 mph mark. April Fool's Day was founded on having fun. Come partake in the crazy camaraderie, you're bound to be astounded by every single run. -Lege",
