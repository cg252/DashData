    "btac_hazard": "<p>There's a children's storybook called <em>Ollies Ski Trip</em>, in which a young boy thanks King Winter for finally bringing winter weather while out skiing through the forest. His sentiments bring forth an imaginary tale of Jack Frost and King Winter as well as Mrs. Thaw - who tries to stamp out and sweep the winter away. It was hard not to feel like a child again yesterday, skinning and skiing cold powder after the recent heat wave. The mountains, specifically the west side of the Teton range picked up an impressive amount of snow, nearing two feet. With that comes a litany of problems and traveling in the mountains today warrants a little more attention given the recent snow and gusty winds. Aside from the wind slabs and potential fast-running sloughs in steep terrain, is the lurking possibility of the sun in its high April angle - ahem, Mrs. Thaw. If the sun emerges today expect widespread wet loose activity. &nbsp;And with nearly two feet of cold snow, it would be an issue I wouldn't want to tangle with in avalanche terrain - be it today or tomorrow when high-pressure returns to the area.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p class=\"nac-html-p\"><strong>Yesterday&nbsp;</strong>Brought the return of winter. Cooler temperatures in the mountains &nbsp;- that averaged in the teens and twenties with the valleys reaching 32 F, coupled with gusty winds (20-30 mph) from W and SW, along with a decent shot of snow quickly erased the memories of this week's warm-up. The west side of the Tetons outperformed most areas with 19'' of snow at Chief Joseph by 0900. &nbsp;Elsewhere several inches were noted from Rendezvous Bowl, Suprise Meadow, and Togwotee - which picked up some snow late in the afternoon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"nac-html-p\"><strong>Today &nbsp;</strong>Expect a mainly dry start to the day then building clouds with afternoon snow showers. Snowfall amounts will be light, less than 3 inches in the mountains and a trace in the valleys - primarily in the northern zones. Winds will be light from the west. Ridging then brings dry weather Saturday through Monday with gradually warming temperatures.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>Human-triggered avalanches are possible today. Yesterday in the upper and middle elevations wind slabs were sensitive given the new snow and gusty west and south west winds. In areas that received higher amounts of snow, like the west side of the Tetons, expect fast-running sloughs in steep terrain where the snow rests upon harder interfaces. If the sun presents itself, expect widespread wet loose activity.&nbsp;Be mindful as you approach avalanche terrain of how the new snow has bonded and use test slopes to gauge its reactivity. Watch for sagging cornices, while hazards in themselves, they can also fail and trigger additional slides.</p>",

Temperatures dropped into the 20s during the day and into the teens last night \u2013 great for stabilizing the mountain and preserving our snow base. We expect similar temperatures today and tonight before the mercury climbs above freezing again on Saturday. The snow on the mountain is firm right now due to recent thawing and refreezing. Look to groomed runs for the best skiing and riding. You can find the grooming status of trails on our website or by using the Solitude app."
