    "btac_hazard": "<p>The overlap of the seasonal transition and buried weak layers produces plenty of fodder for avalanche forecasters. I'll mention wet slabs here not necessarily because I think they are going to be happening today, but because they are likely to be a problem in at least one of the zones, and it is good for us all to still keep persistent layering in mind. At this seasonal stage, slab avalanches are very interesting. A personal observation I've made over time is that some slab activity at this transition never really appears fully wet or dry. Moist slabs?</p>\n<p>On upper and middle-elevation slopes that don't directly face the sun, the snowpack is still cold and dry. At lower elevations and on all slopes that face the sun, the warm temperatures and direct sunshine of the past two weeks have begun to push water down into the snowpack. When the snowpack is freezing solidly at night we like this; it behaves in a more predictable diurnal pattern of melting during the day and then refreezing at night. This pattern usually means that avalanche activity is restricted to surficial wet loose avalanches. However, when ambient air temperatures stay near freezing overnight this re-freeze is much weaker. Without a solid freeze over the span of several days, significant amounts of meltwater can accumulate in the snowpack. If you are out in the mountains today and you are finding a snowpack that is either saturated with water OR recently dry snow surfaces that are now becoming moist on shaded aspects, you will be well served the think about both the possibility of wet avalanches and the possibility of awakening any persistent issues.</p>\n<p><em>As this is my last forecast for the season, I'd like to thank the community surrounding the Bridger-Teton Avalanche Center for their observations, support, and adaptation to some major changes. It has been a pleasure forecasting here and striving to build community and provide a useful product for all users. Thanks and as always, keep it tight in the mountains and have a fun spring!</em></p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday</strong> was a beautiful spring day. Skies cleared throughout the morning leading to bluebird conditions and light southwesterly winds. Temperatures reached 46 F at 9,500 feet in the Tetons, 48 F in the Greys River, and 44 F at Togwotee Pass yesterday. Overnight lows hovered in the high 20s F, and current temperatures are already creeping into the 30s F at 9,000 feet. &nbsp;Skies were mostly clear, allowing the snowpack surface to weakly freeze in open terrain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Today&nbsp;</strong>expect another beautiful day with increasing southwest winds into Tuesday. Temperatures are expected to peak in the 40s F up to 10,000 feet. Tuesday will provide some respite for the snowpack as a cold front moves our way. Expect mostly cooler temperatures, cloudy skies, some light rain and snow showers possible, and increasing southwest winds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"nac-html-p\">&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>Dangerous&nbsp;avalanche conditions will develop during the day at middle and low-elevation slopes. The threat of wet snow avalanches will increase as the day warms up. These slides are most likely on very steep slopes that directly face the sun but are possible on shaded slopes. Additionally be on the lookout for small wind drifts in very steep, upper-elevation terrain, and cornices on ridgelines. Don't linger below large avalanche paths and avoid areas with wet, soggy snow.</p>",

    "solitude_detail": "Get ready for a melty Monday! It'll be a hot & sunny spring day today, with temperatures potentially hitting the low 60's today on the hill. Things will start out relatively firm but will likely turn slushy as the day goes on. These warming temps bring additional avalanche hazard as our historic snowpack begins to melt off and make its way downhill. Our patrollers will be assessing conditions to monitor for hazards, and may close terrain throughout the day. For the latest on terrain status and closures, check the Solitude app. It's a similar story on the roads, with UDOT planning daily canyon closures between 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. thru Thursday this week due to increased avalanche hazard. Check the UDOT website or social media channels for the status of the canyon road and stay tuned to our app or website for the latest updates from Solitude."
