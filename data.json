A very weak system moves through today, bringing the possibility of snow showers in the mountains and rain/snow mix in the interior valleys. &nbsp;Wind slabs are prevalent in the alpine and their sensitivity to triggers could increase with solar input.</p>\n<p>Recent <a title=\"catino ob\" href=\"../../../observations/#/view/d8324167-d443-4b87-9ffb-3362bee468a8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">avalanche activity</a> was observed in the northern portion of GTNP yesterday. Forecaster Catino observed lots of wet loose activity shedding off of steep faces and an impressive avalanche that ran to the valley floor on a south aspect (likely ran during the last storm). Avalanche activity was observed in Avalanche Canyon two days ago, mostly wind slabs that were size 1.5 or less.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Have left the 3/20 and 3/29 persistent slab problems in place for now, but sensitivity is expected to go down after the peak heating today and subsequent refreeze tonight. &nbsp;The 3/29 interface seems to be more of an issue where it is presenting as a crust, northerly aspects do not seem to be as concerning as easterlies and southerlies. The same cannot be said of the 3/20 interface where it is a layer of NSF on NNE aspects.&nbsp;</p>",

Buried crust-facet combinations lurk on NE through E through S slopes, though their strength should continue improve after today's warm up and refreeze.

    "legecast": "6 AM- Greetings and good morning on the final weekend of our 2022-23 ski season. It has been an amazing year, but we aren't done yet. So, hop out of bed, grab your snow sliding gear and jet. A mix of clouds and sunshine will dance across the sky today, alongside mild spring temperatures that rise to just above freezing at the summit and into the low 40's in Teton Village. Light to moderate winds from the West will play a supporting role as they blow between 10-20 mph. Stick around all day and celebrate with the sublime sounds of 40 oz. to Freedom, as they hit the stage beneath the tram at 3pm. Sometimes it seems our society only serves us distressing headlines and impending deadlines. Take refuge from the toxic madness by immersing yourself in purposeless good times. Because richness of the soul comes from skiing lines not chasing bottom lines. -Lege",

Enjoy food, live music \u2014 and spectacular crashes into the pond. Elsewhere on the mountain, most of our terrain is now open with spring conditions present. That means firm conditions to start the day with the snow getting softer by the hour. Temperatures should hang around the mid-30s for most of the day today. We\u2019re expecting cloudy skies in the morning, but the sun should make an appearance by the time the first skimmer goes full send."
