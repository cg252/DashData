    "btac_hazard": "<p>The equation for wet snow avalanches is challenging to solve today.&nbsp; The solution may be found in the warming ambient temperatures overnight combined with an unknown amount of solar input today minus the cooling effect of southwest winds and the shedding that occurred yesterday. If you prefer simpler arithmetic, the solution can be viewed (safely outside of avalanche terrain) mid-day at the confluence of strongest solar gain of the day, the warmest ambient temperaturess since November, both following a warm night with above freezing temperatures. It is possible that the cooling power of the wind and building cloud cover will reverse the warming trend currenly going on and stop the flow of water through the snowpack at some point today but the question remains exactly when this will occur. The wind speeds and the cloud cover this afternoon are the two factors that kept me from pulling the trigger on a high danger rating at mid-elevations in the Tetons today and are pivotal for stopping larger and wide-spread avalanches today.&nbsp; Careful snow and weather evaluation is the name of the game today if you choose to venture into the mountains today.</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p>High pressure brought clear skies and light winds to the region yesterday.&nbsp; Temperatures at 10,000' rose from the upper-tewenties to the lower forties in the Tetons, high 40s in the Greys zone and upper 30s in Togwotee.</p>\n<p><strong>Mountain temperatures remained above freezing overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Low temperatures at most stations occurred around midnight (generally in the mid to upper 30s in Tetons and Greys) before beginning to climb again as SW flow brings even warmer air to the region today.&nbsp; <strong>Temperatures are</strong> <strong>expected to reach the upper forties at 9,000' in the Tetons and low 50s in the Greys zone</strong>. SW winds increase from the low 20s to near 30 mph which will help cool the snow at upper elevations and ridgetops, however, sheltered terrain won't benefit from this cooling effect. Expect mostly sunny skies through the daylight hours before clouds begin to gather this evening.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Precipitation arrives later tonight with 4-6\" snow expected in the high country and some rain showers in the valleys by late tomorrow.</p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>Travel in avalanche paths will be dangerous due to above freezing temperatures last night and the warmest temperatures since November occurring today. Large, natural wet loose avalanches remain likely at most elevations and many aspects with larger, wet slab avalanches now possible as well. Large cornice failures are also possible today. Cautious route-finding will be required to find, manage and avoid these hazards.&nbsp; Reduce your time spent in large and very steep avalanche paths today and avoid them altogether if you find wet, slushy snow underfoot, cornices overhead or warm temperatures and low wind speeds nearby.</p>",

Just a couple weeks ago we were wondering if winter would ever end, but at this point it's safe to say spring has sprung. Highs today will be in the mid 50s with clear but breezy conditions all day - pack some sunscreen and layer lightly! The common theme for the week is ever-changing snow conditions - expect things to be moderately crusty in the morning, transitioning to slushy wet snow pretty quickly as the sun beats down. Avalanche hazards due to a deep and rapidly warming snowpack mean that we may have to close terrain throughout the day for avalanche mitigation work. Keep an eye on the Solitude app for the latest on lift and terrain status as things change on the hill. Friendly reminder that UDOT will be closing the canyon between 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. thru Thursday this week due to increased avalanche hazard. Check the UDOT website or social media channels for the status of the canyon road and stay tuned to our app or website for the latest updates from Solitude."
