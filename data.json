    "btac_hazard": "<p>There is a saying that spring is a battle between winter and summer. While winter has been steadily winning rounds in this year's boxing match, it may be taking a seat as we begin a warming trend today that will likely begin to affect the stability of our snowpack. &nbsp;As we transition from this stormy period into the beginnings of high pressure, wind slabs now can be found across the compass rose from shifting wind directions, all with the potential to stepping down to our persistent weak layer.&nbsp;You'll notice today that we pulled wind slabs off the problem list as their reactivity has been correlated to these weak layers, and we grouped them with our current persistent slab avalanche problem. However, make no mistake if you travel into the higher alpine terrain, specifically around GTNP, expect to find wind slabs in various forms from our shifting wind patterns and train of storms. Furthermore as winter sits down in the corner for a break, the emergence of the sun and rising temperatures will quickly destablize the surface snow. After a deep and long winter it's hard to imagine it's already the first week of April. Keeping that in mind, don't fall trap to winter's slumber and be aware of your surroundings even if you are seeking sheltered and drier snow - making sure you are out of the way and not under steep solar avalanche paths as the spring shed cycle begins. The same goes for cornices, give these a wide berth and be wary of hanging around slopes where these monsters lurk above you.</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday &nbsp;</strong>Began with cold and clear skies in the morning accompanied by light westerly and northwesterly winds. Temperatures stayed cool in the middle and upper elevations, topping out in the 20'sF around 9,000' and near freezing in the valleys with full solar gain. During the late afternoon and evening, winds increased from the west with intermittent snow showers. During this time and overnight the mountains picked up a quick 2-4'' of snow with a maximum of .3'' of snow water equivalent.</p>\n<p><strong>Today&nbsp;</strong>Light snow showers should end this morning and then dry weather is expected as high pressure builds into the area. Temperatures will rise into the 20'sF in the mountains and near 32F in the valleys with SW winds averaging in the teens and gusting in the 20's mph.</p>\n<p><em>Today will be the beginning of a warming trend with \"spring-like\" temperatures. By Sunday afternoon temperatures in the valleys may reach 50 degrees F and mountaintop temperatures will also reflect this warm-up with temperatures climbing above freezing by Sunday afternoon.</em></p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>Triggering a large avalanche remains possible&mdash;especially in wind-affected, upper-elevation terrain were wind slabs have been failing on persistent weak layers. Yesterday a snowmobiler triggered an avalanche near Teton pass that was large enough to injury or bury a person. By midday expect wet loose activity around the southern half of the compass that has the possibility to entrain the recent storm snow in steep avalanche terrain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Despite the cold air temperatures it's April, so any period of sun this time of year will drastically alter the snowpack and its stability. Also as temperatures begin to warm, cornices that have been building all winter long will begin to decrease in strength. Limit exposure beneath these giants and give them a wide berth while traveling along ridgelines.</em></p>",
    "legecast": "4\" of new snow since our lifts closed yesterday with sunshine lined up for today. Look for morning cloud cover to disperse by opening bell with clear and sunny skies throughout the rest of the day. Moderate ridgetop winds will be trending out of the WSW at 10-15 MPH with afternoon temperatures ranging from the low 20's at the top of the Tram to the mid-30's in Teton Village. Ski conditions remain stellar and a nice 4\" cushion up high puts a sweet cherry on top of the season's final Thursday. Come harvest the goods that have been growing since Thanksgiving! It just keeps getting better. Until next year. Much love Jackson! -MB",

As such, Solitude did not operate for skiing or riding. Our lifts will be spinning today, with front side terrain expected to open on schedule and additional terrain opening as the day progresses. Check the UDOT website or social media channels for the status of the canyon road and stay tuned to our app or website for the latest updates from Solitude. The wild storm that arrived Sunday night has finally passed, leaving us with sunny skies and 31 more inches of snow for skiing and riding. We\u2019ve picked up an incredible six feet of fluff in the last eight days, pushing our base to just around the 15-foot mark. Temperatures are expected to start at around 10 degrees and climb into the upper 20s by end of day. We expect even more warming into the weekend, with spring weather arriving just in time for our Pond Skim Beach Party on Saturday."
