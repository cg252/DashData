    "btac_hazard": "<p>It's been a wild ride. Over the past two weeks, our mountains have slowly but surely picked up 2-3'+ of new snow. Cold temperatures have produced uncharacteristically light powder&mdash;it's felt more like February than April lately. The final round of snowfall throughout the remainder of this week will deliver several more inches of snowfall, warming temperatures, and strong, gusty winds.&nbsp; Be prepared to shift your mindset as you head out today and dial back your ambitions as winds increase or if you encounter slabs in unexpected places. The only way to guarantee layers of weak snow won't be an issue is to avoid the terrain where they exist. Unfortunately, that describes a lot of slopes out there. Fortunately, you can significantly reduce your exposure to the hazard by choosing gentler sheltered terrain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Frustrated about the complexities of the above problems this late in spring? Don't worry, I'm there with you. One of my favorite things to do is ski avalanche terrain in the spring, and my preference is steep avalanche terrain. But my priority will always be to come home in one piece at the end of the day. Because of the uncertainty associated with these weak layers, I've taken a step back from steep slopes where these weak layers exist, particularly in places that just had a bunch of snow piled up on top of them. There is lots of good skiing and riding to be found in gentler terrain currently. Being exposed to a number of avalanche problems each day, whether at work or play, means that your margins have to be very clearly defined. Thus, though it may not be my first choice for this time of year, it's the only way I can ensure I can head back out again tomorrow. Enjoy another taste of winter, and take some time to think about the range of hazards you'll be facing today.</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday&nbsp;</strong>saw mixed skies and light winds shifting northeast as a low-pressure system continues to track to our east. A trace to an inch of snowfall fell throughout the day, with 24-hour accumulations of around 3-8 inches in the Greys, 3 inches in the Tetons, and 3 inches at Togwotee Pass.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Today</strong> brings colder temperatures with highs in the twenties and a decrease to the single digits and teens deg F expected into Wednesday. Northeast winds will increase today into the 20-30 mph range with gusts into the 40s. I've said before, nothing good ever comes on a north wind. Snowfall is expected to pause this morning in the Tetons and Togwotee, but continue throughout the day and concentrated to the southern portion of the Greys River zone. 3-5 inches of accumulation is expected, again with locally higher amounts in the Greys.</p>\n<p><em>It is worth already having on your radar that the next nicer clearing is expected Thursday, and moving into next week, temperatures are expected to warm back to \"normal April\" temperatures. Any sunny, calm weather will likely produce a substantial shed cycle on many slopes.</em></p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>Triggering a large, dangerous avalanche remains possible&mdash;especially in wind-affected, upper-elevation terrain. Continued snowfall and strong winds today will create sensitive drifts and add more weight to buried weak layers. &nbsp;Expect to find these in atypical locations, thanks to the strength and direction of the wind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
    "legecast": "6AM - Get on up, because we are down to the final days. With eyes glazed we've entered a realm where even those raised on pow become truly amazed. Over 585 inches of snow has fallen this season! Embracing the big mountain craze is your only hope to escape the moment unfazed. With 2 inches of windblown freshness complementing our deep snow depths, all your wildest dreams remain possible today. Expect cool high temperatures to top out in the upper teens at the summit and the upper 20's down in the base area. Chilly Northeast winds will be gusting between 10-30 mph, so layer accordingly. We don't do Nik-Naks or Paddywhacks, we give powder hounds a bone. Just head to the village if you need to be shown. Then you take a quick Tram trip to the magical zone. -Dr.H\n\u00a0",
