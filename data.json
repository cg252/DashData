    "btac_hazard": "<p>The Tetons picked up maybe 1-3 inches of snow yesterday, mostly in convective cells around midday. Good freeze last night, and not much in the way of wind. Today will be the first majorly sunny day since that nice pulse of snow on Thursday, so things will come a bit unglued in places. Looks like temps will reach the freezing point on the peaks. High pressure is on deck for tomorrow as well. Now the extended outlook is pretty unsettled for the rest of April. It's fun to watch this change on a daily basis and a good reminder that predicting the future is a silly business.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The last wave of high pressure put a pretty solid cap on the seasons snowpack. It will be interesting to see what happens over the course of the next two days as we heat back up. The pack at the middle and upper elevations is still pretty far away from \"isothermal\". &nbsp;Recent avalanche activity has mostly been confined to some wet loose, dry loose, and maybe a rogue wind slab or two.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday:&nbsp;</strong>Mostly cloudy with some convective snow showers, especially around midday. 1-3 inches of snow popped up in certain locations (seems like Victor got the most).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Last Night:&nbsp;</strong>Mostly clear early, then transitioned to partly cloudy. No new snow overnight. Low temperatures are currently in the low 20s in the valleys and near 10 degrees on the peaks. Winds averaged 10 mph out of the West on Rendezvous Summit. Seems like a nice little layer of surface hoar got laid down around 8k'.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Today's Forecast: </strong>HIGH PRESSURE! Mostly sunny with temperatures near freezing on the peaks and in the low 40s in the valleys. Winds will be westerly in the 5-15 mph range on the ridgelines.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>The avalanche danger will start off at <strong>LOW</strong> this morning then transition to <strong>MODERATE</strong> as the snowpack heats up. Small wind slabs remain a possible threat in the alpine, and wet loose activity will be more pronounced on southerly aspects. Monitor the effects of the sun today and seek out dry unconsolidated snow that has not been stiffened by the wind. Minimize exposure time on steep sunlit slopes, especially in and around rocky outcroppings.&nbsp;</p>",

Yesterday we opened all our terrain except Fantasy Ridge and expect the same terrain open again today. For advanced skiers, our gated terrain has been offering both frozen ugh and corn snow bliss.
