    "btac_hazard": "<p class=\"nac-html-p\">Every time we get to enter the backcountry, it is the chance to view our surroundings with a child-like curiosity.&nbsp; When it all boils down to it, skiing or sledding is a chance to play outside with our friends and be in a phenomenally interesting compound (snow) that is in a constant state of change. As you move through the mountains, take the time to observe the nature of the snow you are traveling through. How has the wind reshaped the snowpack overnight, and why does the snow you are moving through feel and look like it does? Look for areas where the wind has scoured down and revealed old ski and sled tracks underneath. Is yesterday's track now nowhere to be found due to winds continuing to move snow? This process of observation is one of the most powerful tools in our safe backcountry travel in our toolkit. It is also what enables us to sniff out areas with good, stable skiing and riding, and makes us masters of our own exposure to hazards. There is always something new (and usually something older to track) in the world of snow, we just have to choose to look.</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday</strong> saw mostly clear skies and colder temperatures with high diffuse clouds in the alpine. Gusts were southwesterly in the 35 mph range and ridgelines at 10,000' saw consistent wind in the teens mph. Light winds are expected today from the S/SW, shifting SE into tomorrow.</p>\n<p><strong>Today,</strong> dry weather will persist until Wednesday morning. Skies are expected to remain overcast but may break down midday allowing some sunshine through. Temperatures are expected to remain below normal, with highs in the 20s deg F and warming into Wednesday's incoming southwest flow. Yet another pulse of active weather and Pacific moisture is headed our way from Wednesday-Friday, with accumulations of 6 inches expected in the mountains, and rain at lower elevations.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>Avoid steep slopes where you find evidence of windblown snow. Slides could also break into buried weak layers, producing a more dangerous avalanche. These are most likely above 9,000 feet and could be triggered remotely&mdash;from gentler terrain below, above, and to the sides of steep slopes. Be alert to the consequences of being caught in an avalanche in the terrain you are traveling in.</p>",
    "legecast": "6 AM: Up and at em' Jackson Hole. Percolate those coffee beans and prepare to be captivated by edge-created smokescreens. Today we'll be kicking up the crystals from a cornucopia of conditions that defy all definitions. That's because we're set up for a transitional weather day here in the Tetons, as partly cloudy skies become mostly cloudy by the afternoon, potentially producing a stray mountain snow shower or two. Chilly morning temperatures will eventually rise to the mid 20's at the summit and the mid 30's down in the Village. Look for the winds to swing towards the Southwest as they clock in between 10-20mph. Come on out and take some desperately needed time for yourself, because conditions like these are coming straight off the top-shelf. -Lege",

The skiing and riding has been phenomenal after picking up 69 inches in the past week - bringing us to a record-breaking season total of 705 inches! The snow isn't over yet though - we're eying another storm that is due to hit late Wednesday, adding to our already deep snowpack as we get into the spring season.
