    "btac_hazard": "<p>Just when you were dusting off your bike, a spring storm is on our doorstep. While most of the avalanche problems associated with it will be confined to the new snow and wind, areas where poor structure has been present like Togwotee Pass, the Greys, Wyoming Range, and the Hoback/Snake River Canyon still pose a threat for triggering wet slab avalanches given the lack of cold temperatures. As you travel through the mountains today, be mindful of how the new snow is bonding to the old surface and pay attention to increases in precipitation and wind speeds - with wind slabs potentially growing in size by the end of the day in the upper elevations. Utilize test slopes to gauge the reactivity of the new snow and practice safe travel techniques.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p class=\"nac-html-p\"><strong>Yesterday </strong>Continued the trend of minimal overnight refreezes in the mountains, with temperatures rising into the 40s F with valleys reaching 50s F. The overcast skies and trace of snow didn't quite pan out during the day and some areas became mostly sunny.&nbsp;Winds were out of the South and Southwest in the teens with gusts around 30 mph. Precipitation moved in late last night.</p>\n<p class=\"nac-html-p\"><strong>Today&nbsp;</strong>Temperatures will be cooler, ranging from 20s to 30s F in the upper and mid-elevations. Winds will be out of the southwest and west in the high teens with gusts nearing 30 mph. Valley temperatures will climb to the middle and upper 30s F. Periods of snow will continue in the northern mountains with steady snow forecasted to continue until mid-morning. Gusty winds will continue today. Valleys will see rain changing to snow with only light accumulations.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>Human-triggered avalanches are possible today. In the upper and middle elevations wind slabs will grow in size from additional snow accumulation and gusty winds out of the SW. You are most likely to find this problem in the middle and upper elevations on leeward-facing slopes and terrain features. At low elevations triggering wet loose slides will be likely, especially if the snow is falling onto wet surfaces. Be mindful as you approach avalanche terrain of how the snow is bonding and use test slopes to gauge its reactivity. Watch for sagging cornices, while a hazard in themselves, they can also fail and trigger additional slides.</p>",

We haven\u2019t seen new snow in seven days \u2014 the longest stretch we've had without snowfall since November this season \u2014 so even a tiny bit of fluff is welcome. The real hero today will be the cold temperatures that help support our base and keep the mountain glued together \u2014 we are planning on skiing and riding deep into May! There are no closures of SR-190 scheduled for today but continue to check the UDOT website or social media channels for the status of the canyon road and stay tuned to our app or website for the latest updates from Solitude."
