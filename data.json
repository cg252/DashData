    "btac_hazard": "<p>Another good freeze last night, though not as strong as the previous one. Temperatures will be warmer today and small wet loose activity should continue to shed in steep solar terrain. Seemed like most of these slides were pretty small and slow yesterday, we will see if they pick up any more steam today. The high albedo of the snow yesterday deterred a fair amount of warming on northerly aspects. Enjoy the sunshine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The pack at the middle and upper elevations is still pretty far away from \"isothermal\". &nbsp;Recent avalanche activity has mostly been confined to some wet loose, dry loose, and maybe a rogue wind slab or two. At this point it looks like a decent trough drops in our zone out of the NW by Tuesday morning. This should bring cooler temps and unsettled weather through at least Thursday (April 20).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Right now the Grand Targhee Snotel sits at 103% median SWE, Pine Creek Pass sits at 153%, Phillips Bench is at 116%, and Grassy Lake is at 112%. So while it seemed like it never stopped snowing and snow heights reached record levels at the middle and lower elevations, the upper elevations in the Tetons have not received a crazy amount of water like our southern neighbors. When and how the water comes out of the mountains will determine the fate of the reservoirs. Right now Jackson Lake sits at 25% full, Palisades Reservoir sits at 38% full, and the evaporative giant that is American Falls sits at 82%. Generally early melting causes a prolonged runoff with lower stream flows and less water capture. Late melting is good.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday:&nbsp;</strong>Mostly sunny with very little wind. The snow remained susprisingly dry in places, likely due to its high albedo.</p>\n<p><strong>Last Night:&nbsp;</strong>Mostly clear, no new snow overnight. Low temperatures are currently in the mid 20s in the valleys and upper teens on the peaks. Winds averaged 10 mph out of the WSW on Rendezvous Summit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Today's Forecast: </strong>HIGH PRESSURE! Mostly sunny with temperatures near 40 degrees on the peaks and in the mid 50s in the valleys. Winds will be south-westerly in the 5-15 mph range on the ridgelines.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>The avalanche danger will start off at <strong>LOW</strong> this morning but could transition to <strong>MODERATE</strong> as the snowpack heats up. Small wind slabs remain a possible threat in the alpine, and wet loose activity will be more pronounced on southerly aspects. Monitor the effects of the sun today and seek out dry unconsolidated snow that has not been stiffened by the wind. Minimize exposure time on steep sunlit slopes, especially in and around rocky outcroppings.&nbsp;</p>",
