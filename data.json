    "btac_hazard": "<p class=\"nac-html-p\">In my earlier years, the question I often asked before committing to avalanche terrain was, \"Do I think this is going to slide?\" If I thought the answer was no, I went for it. This process felt pretty simple, especially in areas I skied frequently and felt I \"knew.\" I knew the conditions under which X&nbsp; or Y slope would avalanche. If those conditions weren't present, it made answering that question all the easier. But asking this question left such a small margin for error because whether or not a slope is going to slide is a tough one to accurately answer. I also answered this question wrong a few times.</p>\n<p class=\"nac-html-p\">Over many years, you see snow behave in a lot of strange ways that surprise you. I've realized that question isn't possible with an acceptable level of certainty. The other day, standing next to a steep slope at Togwotee with my partner, we asked a subtly different question, but that difference is important. <strong>\"Would we be totally surprised if this thing avalanched?\"</strong> This question is more conservative and takes into account the uncertainty faced when dealing with a tricky snowpack.</p>\n<p class=\"nac-html-p\">So do I think someone will trigger a slide today?&nbsp;<em>No</em>. But would I be totally surprised if someone does? The answer is also <em>No</em>. As time has passed and my avalanche knowledge has increased, I've ridden less steep terrain&mdash;not more. When I do ride steep terrain, I enjoy it more knowing that I am more confident in my decision and that I'm exposing myself to less risk.</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday</strong> saw scattered to partially sunny skies with temperatures creeping above 30 deg F at lower elevations by late afternoon. Temperatures above 9,000 feet remained in the 20s deg F, with light easterly winds in the Tetons and westerly winds in the Greys River and Togwotee. The transition from dry to wet snow surface conditions lately bode well for ripping preserved pow fields on a sled, but if plodding along on foot, one is wise to carry skin wax for the way up, and a pocket ski scraper for the way down.</p>\n<p><strong>Today</strong> will be overcast with&nbsp;another pulse of active weather and Pacific moisture is headed our way from Wednesday-Friday. Light flurries are expected before the afternoon, with increasing winds in the 20s-30s mph shifting southwesterly. The primary bulk of this storm will hit overnight and throughout Thursday as flow shifts westerly over our region. Rain is possible midday at lower elevations.&nbsp; Weather models are not aligning well for precipitation amounts for this storm; anywhere from 5-10 inches of snowfall is expected over the next 72 hours.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>To reduce the chance of triggering avalanches, avoid slopes where the wind recently formed drifts or slabs. In areas more protected from the wind, triggering a 2-3 foot thick avalanche is possible. An incoming stream of new snow will continue loading buried weak layers. Pay attention to the consequences of being caught on even smaller steep slopes or terrain with rocks, cliffs, and trees.</p>",
    "legecast": "6AM - Good morning world! We're looking a dry start to the day but if you haven't been satiated by all of the snow this year, fear not: we've got some coming down the pike. The chance of precip will increase this afternoon as the next series of Pacific fronts and troughs arrives. Any snowfall today will be on the lighter side with the steadier stuff rolling in tonight. Wind speeds will increase today as well but nothing too dramatic is expected. High temps around the base will be in the high 30s and the summit will see high 20s. See you on the hill! -Orion",
