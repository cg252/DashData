    "btac_hazard": "<p><strong>Winter Continues...</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another week, and another discussion on how this winter just keeps on rolling. Good thing we love powder around these parts. There&rsquo;s a mixed bag of conditions out there today, as snowfall varied drastically across the forecast zones. The big takeaway is that regardless of where you&rsquo;re recreating, areas with higher amounts of new snow will see higher avalanche danger. This trend will continue into next week. New snow instability and stress added to the persistent slab will require careful terrain management and restraint to push into consequential terrain. These persistent slab avalanches are difficult to predict, especially with the spatial variability altering the likelihood and distribution across aspects and elevations. THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL SPRING. I&rsquo;ve said it over and over, but don&rsquo;t let complacency cloud our judgment with this complex snowpack.&nbsp;</span></p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: An active weather pattern continued with varied snowfall rates: 3&rdquo; in the Tetons, 6&rdquo; at Togwotee, and 16&rdquo; in the Greys. Large differences in snowfall amounts occurred in the Greys, as the southern portion was favored significantly, possibly due to localized snow banding. Warm spring temperatures climbing to the high 20s and low 30s even up to 9000&rsquo;. W/SW winds remained light with moderate intensity in the upper elevations.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong>Today:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Snow showers will persist across the area with 1-3&rdquo; forecasted, except where localized snow banding sets up. The exception to these amounts is again the southern portion of the Greys where up to 6&rdquo; could be added today. Westerly winds will increase by the afternoon to a sustained 20 mph and gusts above 30 mph. Fairly warm temperatures are expected to be similar or slightly cooler than yesterday.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New snow with increasing westerly winds this afternoon sustaining 20 mph will form fresh slabs and stress weak layers buried 2-3 feet deep. Wind loaded terrain will have the highest potential to trigger both wind and persistent slab avalanches. Identify areas where wind is transporting new snow and understand that persistent slab avalanches are unpredictable. Use your best judgment to manage these problems by evaluating the snow and terrain carefully. </span></p>",
    "legecast": "6AM - Another 3\" of snow has blanketed Rendezvous Mountain since lifts closed yesterday. Snow showers will continue on this final day of March with modest accumulation possible throughout the ski day. Winds will be on the stiffer side with steady speeds in the mid-20 mph range and gusts up to 35mph possible especially at the ridge tops. Actuals will reach mid 20s up high and mid 30s at the base, but wind chill could be significantly lower than that in the morning hours. March is almost over, but it looks like winter is sticking around with more snow expected throughout the weekend. Happy rippin'! -Orion",
