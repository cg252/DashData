    "btac_hazard": "<p>Today will be a transition day following the last few days of high pressure, as we will begin to feel the impacts of some colder air and increased chances of snow Monday night into Tuesday. Scattered mountain snow showers will develop in the afternoon, but accumulations will be limited and will not shift our avalanche hazard until Tuesday. With that in mind, temperatures today are still expected to climb into the 40s F in the mountains coupled with a shallow refreeze last night, so continue to limit time around steep solar aspects during peak heating. Current snow surfaces vary upon aspect and elevation. While traveling in the high peaks on Friday in Grand Teton National Park I was finding cold snow and sloughing in very steep terrain above 10,500' - &nbsp;if you're traveling into these peaks today expect to find cold snow on the northerlies and the potential for wind slabs above our forecast zone in addition to the diurnal melt-freeze conditions on the solar aspects. As daytime heating quickly breaks down the melt-freeze conditions, expect wet loose activity to continue to rise - yesterday it was still easy to trigger these on steep sunlit planar slopes at all elevations. The battle between winter and spring rages on tonight, with spring taking a break while winter comes in for another hit.</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p><strong>Yesterday:&nbsp;</strong>High pressure and clear skies. Temperatures rose into the 40s F in the mountains and mid-50s F in the valleys. Winds were light, but the southerly winds increased in the afternoon with some moderate gusts in the upper elevations.</p>\n<p><strong>Last Night:&nbsp;</strong>Clear skies and warmer than two nights ago with shallow refreezes. Winds were moderate out of the southwest with some stronger gusts.</p>\n<p><strong>Today's Forecast:&nbsp;</strong>Temperatures should rise into the 40s F in the mountains with southwest winds in the light to moderate range. Valleys will reach near 50 F. After a mainly dry start showers will increase this afternoon as the next Pacific trough and cold front approach the area (freezing level will rise to near 8,000' today if any precipitation arrives). Widespread showers will break out this evening, and after a lull later today and early Tuesday, more substantial snow will arrive Tuesday midday associated with the cold front - producing &nbsp;over 6 inches in the Tetons.</p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>The avalanche danger today will rise as the daytime temperatures do. This morning we'll have Low danger, and as the snowpack heats up again it will transition to a Moderate hazard on slopes facing east, through south, and west. Temperatures overnight were warmer than the previous day, so be ready to shift plans if you begin breaking through the diurnal crusts.&nbsp;Small wind slabs remain possible in the high peaks - above the forecasted zone of 10,500'. Minimize exposure when traveling on steep solar aspects, especially around rock outcroppings and below cornices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Last night was warm with a shallow refreeze, some mountain locations did not drop below freezing.</em></p>",
