Clouds could gradually increase throughout the day as a moisture starved short-wave trough begins to impact the area tonight. These clouds could mitigate some wet loose development at the lower elevations but there is some uncertainty surrounding this situation. Wind slabs are prevalent in the alpine and their sensitivity to triggers could increase with solar input.</p>\n<p>Recent avalanche activity was observed in Avalanche Canyon yesterday, mostly wind slabs that were size 1.5 or less.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Have left the 3/20 and 3/29 persistent slab problems in place for now, but sensitivity is expected to go down after the peak heating today and subsequent refreeze tonight. Clouds should mitigate some solar impacts tomorrow, and then we are back into full on high pressure with seasonal to above average temperatures. Looking at the long term forecast it's not looking very snowy for April right now, but that could obviously change.&nbsp;</p>",

    "btac_bottomline": "<p>Human triggered avalanches remain possible today, especially in steep, rocky, wind exposed areas at the middle and upper elevations. Buried crust-facet combinations lurk on NE through E through S slopes, though their strength should improve after today's warm up and refreeze. Moniter the effects of the sun on the snow surface today and minimize exposure time on steep sunlit slopes.&nbsp;</p>",
    "legecast": "Bruce Springskiing will be out in full force today at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. No snow to report in the past 24hrs but at just 6\" shy of a 600\" total for the season, there's plenty of goods to go around. The high pressure system that's kicking around will bring mainly dry weather through the daylight hours today accompanied by light to moderate winds. Temps are going to feel positively tropical mountain wide and should make for some exceptional warm weather shredding conditions. That's it for me this season! Thanks for a great one and we'll see you next November! -Orion",

After a very wintery start of the week, and a snowverwhelming Wednesday during which the canyon closed, we are now looking at several days of temperatures above freezing, along with quite a bit of sunshine. Today we expect partly cloudy skies and a high of around 37 \u2014 time to put away your powder shell (at least for now) and put on some sunscreen. The snow from recent storms has started to settle, but it\u2019s still very playful out there. For a fun lap, dig your edges into Sunshine Bowl when the morning crunch begins to soften. What\u2019s all that activity taking place at the base of Apex Express? We\u2019re not building a swimming pool for the summer season \u2014  it\u2019s our mountain ops team prepping the hill for Saturday\u2019s Pond Skim Beach Party.
