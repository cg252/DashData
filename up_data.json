    "btac_hazard": "<p>Spring is officially here and with that comes changing conditions. As convection plays a larger role in the storms we receive, the predictability of the weather drastically goes down. This is that chaos stuff Lorenz was talking about it the 60s (look it up). As the predictability of the weather goes down so does the predictability of avalanches, especially those involving new snow and wind. Snowfall rates will spike this morning while winds will increase this afternoon on the backside of a cold front. So if I had to guess (which is my job) storm slabs will play a bigger role this morning while wind slabs will be on the rise throughout the afternoon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Recent avalanche activity has involved new storm snow and wind slabs up to size 1.5. Some of these avalanches have been triggered remotely.</p>\n<p>Snow depths are surpassing 3 meters at many locations at the middle and upper elevations throughout the range. The March 20th interface is now buried 1-3 feet deep on most aspects at the upper elevations.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_weatherdisc": "<p>Yesterday was mostly cloudy with convective snow showers throughout western Wyoming. <strong>Grand Targhee has received up to 22 inches of new snow in the last 24 hrs.&nbsp;</strong>Over the last 24 hours the east side of Tetons have picked up 4-9 inches of snow (ranging from the low elevations to the high), the Greys have picked up 4-10 inches, and Togwotee grabbed 5-7 inches. Currently temperatures in the valleys are around 15 degrees while the peaks are in the single digits. Winds averaged 19 mph out of the SW on Rendezvous Summit with a total of 451 miles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The forecast for today is for more snow showers as the trough axis moves to the easy of the forecast area. Post-frontal winds will slowly taper throughout the day with &nbsp;sustained ridgeline winds in the 15-20 mph range with gusts in the 30s out of the WNW. New snowfall accumulations in the 3-5 inch range are expected for most locations above 8,000 feet, with lower amounts in the valleys. It seems like post frontal convection has really kicked in on the west side of the Tetons which should result in locally higher snowfall totals. High temperatures are expected to reach near 15 degrees on the peaks and around 25 degrees in the valleys.&nbsp;</p>",
    "btac_bottomline": "<p>The avalanche danger will increase throughout the day as new snow and wind will conspire to create fresh wind and storm slabs. Human triggered avalanches are<strong> LIKELY</strong> at the middle and upper elevations, especially on the west side of the Tetons where up to 22 inches of snow has fallen in the last 24 hours. Pay attention to signs of instability such as cracking within wind drifted snow and upside down storm snow.</p>",
    "legecast": "6AM - Rise and shine Jackso....wait, what the... hey. Look! Up in the sky! More powerful than a locomotive, allowing you to leap tall cliffs in a single bound. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's powder, man. 9 more inches of the magical medium landed on Rendezvous Mountain over the past 24 hours, granting you the gumption to play in a superhero way. Expect continued snowfall through the day with gusty West winds whipping up vapor contrails in your wake. High temperatures will be cool for the date, topping out in the teens at the summit and the low to mid-20's down in the Villy. Now grab your gear and get out here, because it's time for you to get silly. -Lege",
